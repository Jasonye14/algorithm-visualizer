# Sorting Visualizer ðŸ“Š

**Sorting Visualizer** is an interactive React application that visually represents various sorting algorithms in action. Users can select a sorting algorithm, adjust the speed of the visualization, and keep track of the number of swaps made by the algorithm.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Visual Representations** of different sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.
- **Interactive Controls** for modifying the animation speed.
- **Dynamic Color Coding** to help understand algorithm operations.
- **Real-time Statistics Display** to showcase the number of swaps.
- **Responsive Design** that looks great on all devices.

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

- **React**: Powers the interactive UI.
- **React Icons**: Used for scalable vector icons.
- **CSS**: Styling and animations.

## ðŸš€ How to Run Locally

1. **Clone** the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualizer.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project:
   ```bash
   cd sorting-visualizer
   ```
   
3. Install Dependencies:
